# sofia_call_signal

The project contains:
- Simple scraper for a particular website Sofia Call.
- Data Analysis worksheets

The scraper is written with the help of ChatGPT.

A personal project to extract and analyze discrepancies of public Sofia municipality answers to people reporting infrastructucture problems all around the city. 

The extracted data is public, but missing any transparency, search and analytics (typical for government administration).

The goal is to provide transparency to my fellow neighbours and fight local government's negligence and corruption.
